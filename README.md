## Instructions

This project was created for the *Udacity Front-End Nanodegree* program in May of 2018.

It is a version of the classic memory game where users will attempt to match two cards. If they match correctly, then the cards will remain face up and they can no longer select them. 

Once all matches have been made, the game is complete and you will see a modal dialog box containing your score.

The star scoring is based on the number of moves you make:

* Less than 10 moves = __5__ Stars
* Less than 13 moves = __4.5__ Stars
* Less than 16 moves = __4__ Stars
* Less than 19 moves = __3.5__ Stars
* Less than 22 moves = __3__ Stars
* Less than 25 moves = __2.5__ Stars
* Less than 28 moves = __2__ Stars
* Less than 31 moves = __1.5__ Stars
* More than 30 moves = __1__ Star
